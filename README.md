Welcome! Today we'll be pulling in live data from a weather service to add to our weather web app. We've provided the webpage for you to look at and learn from, so feel free to dive under the hood (Web Inspector) to learn how it was constructed. You'll get more familiarized with Javascript in the process.

You can see the end result of this workshop [here](http://rawgit.com/DevelopersGuild/weatherapp_tutorial/master/Part%202/index.html). Try clicking on the city or state name, you can change the location dynamically!

## To get started:
1. Click "Download ZIP" on the right side of this page.
2. Unzip, open the folder
3. Open in your preferred text editor.
4. If you're using [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com/), you can right click while you're in the file and click open in browser. Otherwise, drag the index.html to your browser, and it should open the page.

## Other useful stuff:

We've learned about API's today, and mentioned a data format called JSON. To learn more about how HTTP requests and API's work, Codecademy has a good primer on it. [Check it out here.](http://www.codecademy.com/courses/javascript-beginner-en-EID4t/0/1?curriculum_id=5122e6f8b2cb8a8e97000a01)

Get Google Chrome! Its developer tools are really helpful for  styling your page live. Once you've done so, [set up Workspace.](https://developer.chrome.com/devtools/docs/workspaces)
